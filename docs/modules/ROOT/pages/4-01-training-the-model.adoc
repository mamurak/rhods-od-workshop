= 4.1 Fine Tuning and Training a Model

NOTE: This is a new and advanced section of the workshop.

Now it is time to fine tune and train a model using RHOAI and Data Science Pipelines.

* In Jupyter, go to the *model-training* folder
* Run the *model-training.pipeline*

Depending on the resources available, this may take some time.

The training pipeline will upload the refined model in your bucket.

NOTE: With the current workshop implementation, only one training pipeline can run for each user at the same time.

To test the updated model, go back to `2_online_scoring.ipynb` notebook.
Make sure you use the updated class labels:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
class_labels = ['Laptop', 'Computer keyboard', 'Table']
----

After we have verified the model, we can finally deploy it and update the app.

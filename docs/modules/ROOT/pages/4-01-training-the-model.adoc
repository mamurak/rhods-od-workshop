= 4.1 Fine Tuning and Training a Model

NOTE: This is a new and advanced section of the workshop.

Now it is time to fine tune and train a model using RHOAI and Data Science Pipelines.

* In Jupyter, go to the *model-training* folder
* Run the *model-training.pipeline*

Depending on the resources available, this may take some time.

The training pipeline will upload the refined model in your bucket.

NOTE: With the current workshop implementation, only one training pipeline can run for each user at the same time.

Once the pipeline finishes running, you can find the new model artifact in the object detection S3 bucket under 2 IDs:

* `model-latest.onnx` refers to the most recently trained model. It's a dynamic, mutable reference.
* `model-[timestamp].onnx` refers to the very model artifact that was created at `[timestamp]`. It's used as a static, immutable reference.

Note the ID of the new model artifact, preferrably the timestamped version.

To test the new model, go back to the `1_explore` notebook. Update `model_id` to the ID of the new model artefact. Update the class labels as follows:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
class_labels = ['Laptop', 'Computer keyboard', 'Table']
----

You can now re-run the whole notebook to test the model within the workbench and see the new object detection results.

After we have verified the model in the workbench, we can finally deploy it and update the app.

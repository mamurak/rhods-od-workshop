= 4.2 Deploying and Integrating the New Model

In order to use the new model in the applications deployed before, you need to the reconfigure the service app created in section 2.2. You can try the following:

* Following the guidelines from section 2.1 Serving a model, deploy the new model under *Models and model servers*
* Copy the Inference endpoint of the new model
* Using the *OpenShift Console*, go to the service application created in section 2.2 and update the `PREDICTION_URL` environment variable to the new model's inference endpoint (effectively switching models)
* In addition, while in the *OpenShift Console* create a ConfigMap containing the following class labels:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,text]
----
'Laptop', 'Computer keyboard', 'Table'
----

* In the same service application, add also the `CLASS_LABELS` environment variable pointing to the created ConfigMap:

Once both environment variables have been updated/added, the application will be redeployed.

Once the service has been redeployed and started consuming the new model through the new inference endpoint, you can test the changes brought by the new model using your camera or mobile device as before.

= 1.2 The Jupyter environment

include::_attributes.adoc[]

You are now inside your Jupyter environment. As you can see, it's a web-based environment, but everything you'll do here is in fact happening on the *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* cluster. This means that without having to install and maintain anything on your own computer, and without disposing of lots of local resources like CPU and RAM, you can still conduct your Data Science work in this powerful and stable managed environment.

In the "file-browser" like window you're in right now, you'll find the files and folders that are saved inside your own personal space inside *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science*. It's pretty empty right now though... So the first thing we will do is to bring the content of the workshop inside this environment.

* On the left toolbar, click on the Git icon:

* Then click on *Clone a Repository*:

* Enter the git *https* URL, `https://github.com/mamurak/object-detection-rest.git`, then click *CLONE*:

* It takes a few seconds, after which you can double-click and navigate to the newly-created folder, `object-detection-rest`:

This JupyterLab instance also features an *Object Storage Browser*. Let's connect to your S3 bucket and review its contents:

* Open the Object Storage Browser by selecting the bucket icon on the top of the left toolbar.

* Fill in the settings as follows:

** In *Object storage endpoint* write `http://s3.openshift-storage.svc`.

** For the *Access key* and *Secret key* values, copy and paste the corresponding values from the Secret that you reviewed in the former section.

* Select *Connect* to access your S3 bucket. Double click on the bucket with your user ID. You can now browse the content of your S3 bucket including a number of images and the model artifact. We will access and work with that model in the following sections.
